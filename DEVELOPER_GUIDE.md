# Developer Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for our comprehensive React application with TypeScript integration. This guide will walk you through the application's architecture, component structure, and implementation details.

## Application Overview

The application is designed to represent numbers within a specified range using a visual representation, such as a progress bar or a numerical indicator. It is built with React and TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance code maintainability.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, make sure you have Node.js installed. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several directories and files:

- `src/index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that orchestrates the number visualization.
- `src/components/`: Directory containing reusable React components.
  - `NumberVisualizer.tsx`: Component for visualizing the number as a progress bar.
  - `NumberInput.tsx`: Component for user input to change the number.
- `src/styles/`: Directory containing CSS modules for styling components.
- `src/types/`: Directory containing TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
- `src/hooks/`: Directory containing custom React hooks.
  - `useNumberState.ts`: Hook for managing the number state.
- `src/utils/`: Directory containing utility functions.
- `src/tests/`: Directory containing test files for components.

## Components

### App Component

The `App.tsx` component sets up the main layout and state management for the application. It imports the `NumberVisualizer` and `NumberInput` components and handles their interactions.

### NumberVisualizer Component

`NumberVisualizer.tsx` is responsible for displaying the visual representation of the number. It accepts `value` and `max` props to determine the progress.

### NumberInput Component

`NumberInput.tsx` allows the user to input a number. It takes a `onChange` callback as a prop to update the state in the parent component when the input changes.

## State Management

The `useNumberState.ts` hook is used to manage the state of the number. It provides the current value and a setter function to update the value.

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are located in the `src/tests/` directory. Each component has a corresponding test file:

- `App.test.tsx`
- `NumberVisualizer.test.tsx`
- `NumberInput.test.tsx`

Run the tests using:

```sh
npm test
```

## Code Style and Best Practices

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style and best practices. Configuration files for both are included in the project root.

## Documentation

Each component, function, and hook is documented with JSDoc comments to explain usage, parameters, and return values.

## Continuous Improvement

We continuously evaluate and improve the application's performance, usability, and accessibility. Feedback is crucial, and we encourage contributions that adhere to our coding and design standards.

## Conclusion

This guide provides an overview of the application's structure and components. For detailed information on each part, refer to the inline documentation and comments within the codebase. Happy coding!
