# Developer Guide

Welcome to the developer guide for our comprehensive React application with TypeScript integration. This guide will walk you through the application's architecture, component structure, and implementation details.

## Application Architecture

The application's architecture is structured around a central React component system, where each component is responsible for a specific part of the application's functionality. The `App.tsx` serves as the root component that orchestrates the interaction between user interface components and application logic. The `NumberVisualizer.tsx` component is responsible for the visual representation of numbers using progress bars or other graphical elements, and the `NumberInput.tsx` allows for user input, updating the visualized number in response to user actions. All components are strongly typed using TypeScript, providing a robust foundation for scaling and maintainability. Additionally, the use of Redux for state management facilitates predictable data flow and ease of testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, make sure you have Node.js installed. Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several directories and files:

- `src/index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that orchestrates the number visualization.
- `src/components/`: Directory containing reusable React components.
  - `NumberVisualizer.tsx`: Component for visualizing the number as a progress bar.
  - `NumberInput.tsx`: Component for user input to change the number.
- `src/styles/`: Directory containing CSS modules for styling components.
- `src/types/`: Directory containing TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
- `src/hooks/`: Directory containing custom React hooks.
  - `useNumberState.ts`: Hook for managing the number state.
- `src/utils/`: Directory containing utility functions.
- `src/tests/`: Directory containing test files for components.

## Components

### App Component

The `App.tsx` component sets up the main layout and state management for the application. It imports the `NumberVisualizer` and `NumberInput` components and handles their interactions.

### NumberVisualizer Component

`NumberVisualizer.tsx` is responsible for displaying the visual representation of the number. It accepts `value` and `max` props to determine the progress.

### NumberInput Component

`NumberInput.tsx` allows the user to input a number. It takes a `onChange` callback as a prop to update the state in the parent component when the input changes.

## State Management

The `useNumberState.ts` hook is used to manage the state of the number. It provides the current value and a setter function to update the value.

## Adding New Features

To add new features or modify existing ones, follow these best practices:

1. Identify the area of the application where the new feature fits or the existing feature needs modification.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or enhancement from the latest version of the main branch.
3. Develop your new feature or enhancement in isolation, ensuring that it does not affect unrelated parts of the application.
4. Write unit and integration tests for your code, aiming to cover all new functionalities as well as potential edge cases.
5. Update relevant documentation to reflect the changes introduced by your feature or enhancement.
6. Follow the coding standards and maintain the established code quality level within the project.
7. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a clear title and a detailed description of the changes. Include any relevant issue numbers.

Please ensure that you thoroughly test new features and that they undergo a peer-review process before merging into the main codebase.

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are located in the `src/tests/` directory. Each component has a corresponding test file:

## Testing

Tests play a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and robustness of our application. Our testing suite includes unit and integration tests that help us identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

### Test Structure

Tests are organized into the `src/tests/` directory with a structure mirroring that of the `src/components/` directory, ensuring a clear and maintainable correspondence between components and their tests. Each React component has a corresponding test file that contains both unit and integration tests relevant to that component.

### Adding New Tests

When adding a new feature or making changes to existing code, you should also create or update tests to cover the new functionality. Follow these steps when adding new tests:

1. Identify the behaviors and edge cases that need to be tested for your code changes.
2. Add new test cases to the relevant test file, or create a new test file if it does not already exist.
3. Write simple and clear test descriptions that convey the purpose of the test.
4. Use `describe` and `it` blocks to group tests logically and express test intentions.
5. Run your tests to ensure they pass and accurately reflect the expected behavior of your code.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite and assess the code quality and functionality of the components:

```sh
npm test
```

This command will execute all tests and report the outcomes in the terminal. You can run individual test suites or test files by specifying the test file's name or pattern in the command.

- `App.test.tsx`
- `NumberVisualizer.test.tsx`
- `NumberInput.test.tsx`

Run the tests using:

```sh
npm test
```

## Code Style and Best Practices

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style and best practices. Configuration files for both are included in the project root.

## Documentation

Each component, function, and hook is documented with JSDoc comments to explain usage, parameters, and return values.

## Continuous Improvement

We continuously evaluate and improve the application's performance, usability, and accessibility. Feedback is crucial, and we encourage contributions that adhere to our coding and design standards.

## Conclusion

This guide provides an overview of the application's structure and components. For detailed information on each part, refer to the inline documentation and comments within the codebase. Happy coding!
