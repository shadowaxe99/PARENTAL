```

## Documentation

For a high-level overview of the application's architecture, the Number Visualizer is structured into modular components that encapsulate specific functionalities, making the project scalable and maintainable. The application follows a component-driven design, with React components managed by Redux for state management. Front-end routing is handled by React Router, and data visualization is powered by D3.js and other visualization libraries.

For a comprehensive explanation of the application's architecture, component structure, and implementation details, please refer to the `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` file.
