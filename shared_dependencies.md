Shared Dependencies:

1. **React and ReactDOM** - Used in "src/index.tsx" for rendering the application and in various components for building the UI.
2. **TypeScript** - Used across all `.tsx` and `.ts` files for type checking and defining interfaces and types.
3. **CSS Modules** - Imported in component files like "src/App.tsx", "src/components/NumberVisualizer.tsx", and "src/components/NumberInput.tsx" for styling.
4. **Custom Hooks** - "useNumberState" hook defined in "src/hooks/useNumberState.ts" and used in components for state management.
5. **Testing Libraries** - Such as Jest and React Testing Library, used in "src/tests/App.test.tsx", "src/tests/NumberVisualizer.test.tsx", and "src/tests/NumberInput.test.tsx".
6. **ESLint and Prettier** - Configuration files ".eslintrc.js" and ".prettierrc" for code linting and formatting used across all `.tsx` and `.ts` files.
7. **Type Definitions** - Defined in "src/types/index.d.ts" and shared across component and utility files for consistent type usage.
8. **Helper Functions** - Defined in "src/utils/helpers.ts" and used across components for shared logic.
9. **Accessibility Attributes** - Such as `aria-*` attributes used in component files for accessibility compliance.
10. **Progress Bar Component** - Defined in "src/components/NumberVisualizer.tsx" and used in "src/App.tsx" for visual representation of numbers.
11. **Number Input Component** - Defined in "src/components/NumberInput.tsx" and used in "src/App.tsx" for user interaction.
12. **DOM Element IDs** - Such as `id` for the progress bar container and input elements, used in components for referencing and styling.
13. **State Management Interfaces** - Defined in "src/types/index.d.ts" and used in "src/hooks/useNumberState.ts" and components for managing state.
14. **APIs and SDKs** - Definitions and usage in "src/types/index.d.ts" and components for integration with Elysium OS and third-party developers.
15. **Environment Configuration** - ".env" files (not listed but implied) for storing environment variables used across the application.
16. **README.md and DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md** - Documentation files that reference components, hooks, utilities, and other parts of the application for developer guidance.
17. **Setup Tests Configuration** - "__tests__/setupTests.ts" for configuring the testing environment shared by all test files.
18. **Gitignore** - ".gitignore" for specifying untracked files that Git should ignore, shared by the entire project repository.

These shared dependencies ensure that the application's components and utilities work together cohesively, following the specified requirements and architectural decisions.
